# LoveSpaceGame

A bullet hell style game written in lua using the love game engine.

As it stands it's basically a re-creation of the very first flash game I
made.

# How to Run

1. Download the version of love for your platform.
2. Invoke the `love` executable as `love .` in the current directory.

## Alternately install love from your distro's repository:

### Arch

    pacman -S love


## Ubuntu

    apt install love
