# LoveSpaceGame

A bullet hell style game written in lua using the love game engine.

As it stands it's basically a re-creation of the very first flash game I
made. Read the related blog post at: https://www.henryschmale.org/2020/11/29/love-game-engine.html

# How to Run

2. Invoke the `love` executable as `love .` in the current directory.

## Alternately install love from your distro's repository:
